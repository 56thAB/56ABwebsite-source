      <strong>Improving Mouse Performance</strong>
      <br />
      If you have an old mouse, consider upgrading to a cheap gaming mouse from popular brands like Logitech, SteelSeries, or Razer (at least $50). These mice have more precise and faster sensors, work at high speeds without bugs, and offer various technical improvements.

      <strong>Optimizing Settings</strong>
      <br />
      In your mouse software, adjust the polling rate to the highest available setting and disable acceleration and angle snapping.

      <strong>Recommended Sensitivity</strong>
      <br />
      Aim for a sensitivity of around 20-60cm/360Â° for optimal performance.

      <strong>DPI and In-Game Sensitivity</strong>
      <br />
      High DPI is generally better for the following reasons:

        Comparing High DPI vs Low DPI:

        50% Less Input Lag! Low DPI vs. High DPI Analysis:

      <li>
        In Planetside, when using vehicles, high DPI changes the acceleration curve to a more predictable one for air and ground vehicles.

      <strong>Important Notes:</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>Note 1:</strong> If you have a cheap mouse with high DPI, it may have smoothing effects or acceleration, or a fake high DPI.
      <br />
      <strong>Note 2:</strong> For Planetside, setting DPI higher than 2000 is unnecessary, as it may not have low enough sensitivity values to match your old sensitivity.
